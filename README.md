# Double-Linked-List

## What does it do? 
This program demonstrates the usage of a double-linked list data structure in Java. A double-linked list is a data structure similar to a linked list, but each node has references to both the next and previous nodes.
In this program, the doubly-linked list is used to store and manipulate Book objects. 
The program showcases various operations that can be performed on a doubly-linked list, including:
- Adding elements to the beginning of the list using the insertStart method.
- Adding elements at a specified position in the list using the insertAtPos method.
- Adding elements to the end of the list using the insertAtEnd method.
- Printing the contents of the list using the print method.
- Checking if the list is empty using the isEmpty method.
- Retrieving the size of the list using the size method.
- Removing an element at a specified position in the list using the removeAtPos method.

The program prompts the user for input to create and manipulate the list. It uses a Scanner object to read and parse user input for book names and ISBNs. The user can enter the number of books, add books at different positions, remove books from specified positions, and view the resulting list after each operation.
By running this program, you can observe how the doubly-linked list behaves and see the results of these operations in action. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications that require double linked list-like behavior, such as maintaining a dynamic collection of data, implementing a playlist, or managing a linked list of tasks with bidirectional navigation.
